### For Players

### For the Team
- Now, we don't add all the turrets to multiple parts of the source code. We only add them into the Enum in the TurretBase for the code side. Then we add them into the Array in the BP_TurretSlot. And we set the type of the turret when we create its BP. That's all!
- Added a new cheat command: By pressing Num 1, you are collecting all yellow globes during Play state.
